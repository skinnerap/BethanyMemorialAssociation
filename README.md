This is a React web application I built for a client. They are a memorial association who wanted to be able to curate a digital version of their history, allowing users to submit files and photos for approval, which an administrator can then approve or deny. Approved file submissions are displayed on the website dynamically. This website using React on the frontend, Node.js and Express for the API and connecting the front and back ends, and Firebase as the backend to store all files and data. To handle file submissions I used a middleware on my node code called Multer, which allows me to easily use contact form data.
